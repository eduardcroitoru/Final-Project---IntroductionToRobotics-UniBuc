# Final-Project---IntroductionToRobotics-UniBuc

Remote-controlled rover where both the rover and the remote are Arduino-based.
The remote sends the input through Wi-Fi, then the signal gets picked-up by the rover.

My build will look different and will use a custom Arduino-based remote instead o a smartphone app.
The computing part will be done mostly by the rover board.
The minimum demo will be a rover that can only go forward and backward at a set speed.
No need for an ESP32-based board.
